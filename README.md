# Project Overview

This project was completed in Tableau Desktop. ComfyBunk is a fictional startup in the field of hospitality, renting out rooms of various types and sizes across the United States. While the company seemed to have a great start in the industry, it saw a drop in revenue during its third year of operation. The purpose of this project was to provide insight into ComfyBunk's financial health and create a dashboard that the company executives can use to monitor key KPIs across the cities they service. A list of tasks that I completed in this project include:

- Joined two datasets together by utilizing Tableau's relationship feature
- Took several pre-defined KPI definitions and transferred them into Tableau by utilizing calculated fields
- Created visualizations for several of the key KPIs, including a dual-axis chart that displays two KPIs at once
- Increased the understandability of the visualizations by properly formatting the axes
- Created a dashboard displaying key KPIs with a single city filter that controls all of the visualizations
- Used the dashboard to analyze the performance of the company as well as make business driven recommendations such as seasonal pricing and scaling down to fewer cities
